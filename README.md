# libpca9606

Driver for the NXP Semiconductors PCA9605/06 40-bit I2C-bus I/O port with RESET, OE and INT ([datasheet](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9606/tree/master/docs/PCA9605_06.pdf))

## Features

- Tests with [greatest](https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest) and [theft](https://github.com/silentbicycle/theft)
- Bring your own I2C and hardware interface libraries
- Minimal dependencies

## Goals

- Strict, full implementation of manufacturer specifications
- A clean, user-friendly interface for application developers and library writers
- No tight coupling to a specific I2C library or hardware platform (Linux I2C, various Pi/Arduino libraries, etc.)
- No tight coupling to a specific application (LEDs vs. servos, etc.)
- Modern C (C11) development practices, like unit tests, property-based tests, [modern CMake (3.13)](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/), etc.

## Usage

Example application code might look something like this:

```C
#include "libpca9606.h"

}
```

## How do I contribute?

Contributions are welcome! Check out [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9606/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.

## How is this library versioned?

This library follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/minnowpod/libpca9606/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
